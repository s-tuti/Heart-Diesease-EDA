## Introduction
Heart disease is a critical public health issue and a leading cause of death globally. This analysis uses data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to explore factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases, such as obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity.

## Data Description
The dataset includes records of 319,795 individuals with features such as:
- **Health Indicators**: BMI, Physical and Mental Health Days, Sleep Time
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity
- **Medical Conditions**: Diabetes, Kidney Disease, Stroke, Asthma

The target feature is **HeartDisease**, indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualization of categorical and continuous features
- Identification of outliers and missing values
- Examination of relationships between variables and heart disease occurrence

## Statistical Testing
Hypothesis testing and Pearson's Chi-square test were applied to examine the statistical significance of categorical variables, with a Shapiro-Wilk test for continuous data normality assessment.

## Machine Learning Analysis
Multiple classifiers, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest, were evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing models for heart disease prediction.

## Recommendations
This section provides 10 essential measures for heart disease prevention, such as maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and monitoring blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels.
